# AlfiVR
This repository contains scripts to process AlfiVR project data;
To run the scripts, first run 'startup.m' from the root directory to load all relevant paths.
All functions/scripts should be run from the root directory, relative paths are defined within.
Data should be placed within the root directory in folder named 'data';
.analytics files should be placed in a subfolder called 'analytics' - 'collect_data.m' will look for files there.
